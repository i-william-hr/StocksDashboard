# 📈 Simple Stock & Portfolio Dashboard

A lightweight, Python-based web dashboard to track your stock, crypto, and commodity holdings. Built with **Streamlit**, it provides real-time data visualization, automatic gain/loss calculations based on purchase dates, and a mobile-friendly interface.

## ✨ Features

* **Portfolio Management**: Add/Remove stocks, crypto, or precious metals via the UI.
* **Performance Tracking**: Calculates Net Worth, Total Gain/Loss (%), and individual asset performance.
* **Visualizations**: Interactive Pie charts (Allocation), Bar charts (Gains), and Historical Performance graphs.
* **Automatic Data Fetching**: Uses `yfinance` to pull real-time prices and historical data.
* **Authentication**: Built-in simple login system with a "Magic URL" bypass for kiosk/monitor displays.
* **Mobile Optimized**: Responsive design with specific tweaks for iOS/mobile viewing.
* **Persistent Storage**: Saves portfolio data to a local JSON file (no database required).

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* `pip` (Python Package Manager)

## 🚀 Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/stock-dashboard.git](https://github.com/yourusername/stock-dashboard.git)
    cd stock-dashboard
    ```

2.  **Set up a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit yfinance pandas plotly
    ```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Authentication
Open `app.py` and locate the **Security Configuration** section. Update these values to secure your dashboard:

```python
# --- Security Configuration ---
AUTH_USER = "admin"       # Set your username
AUTH_PASS = "password"    # Set your password
AUTH_TOKEN = "secret_key" # Set your magic URL token
```

* **Standard Access:** Login via username/password.
* **Kiosk Access:** Bypass login using `http://ip:8501/?auth=YOUR_TOKEN`.

## 🖥️ Usage

### Quick Start
To run the dashboard interactively:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Running in Production (Screen/Background)
A helper script `run.sh` is included to manage the virtual environment and launch parameters automatically.

1.  Make it executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x run.sh
    ```
2.  Run it:
    ```bash
    ./run.sh
    ```

### 🌐 Reverse Proxy (Nginx) Support
If you are hosting this behind Nginx (e.g., at `yourdomain.com/stocks/`), you need to configure Streamlit to know its base URL.

1.  **Edit `run.sh`**:
    Uncomment or add the `baseUrlPath` argument as noted in the file comments:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py --server.baseUrlPath /stocks
    ```

2.  **Nginx Config**:
    Ensure your Nginx block handles the websocket upgrade headers:
    ```nginx
    location /stocks/ {
        proxy_pass [http://127.0.0.1:8501](http://127.0.0.1:8501);
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    }
    ```

## 📝 Common Ticker Examples
When adding assets in the dashboard:
* **US Stocks**: `AAPL`, `MSFT`, `NVDA`
* **European Stocks**: Add the suffix (e.g., `AUM5.DE` for Xetra, `ASM.AS` for Amsterdam).
* **Precious Metals**: `XAUUSD=X` (Gold), `XAGUSD=X` (Silver).
